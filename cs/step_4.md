## Aktualizace pip

If you're using an older version of Raspbian, the version of pip installed might out of date, which can cause problems. Therefore, it's a good idea to keep your software up to date.

To upgrade all the software on your Raspberry Pi, including `pip`:

- Open a terminal window by clicking **Menu** > **Accessories** > **Terminal**.
