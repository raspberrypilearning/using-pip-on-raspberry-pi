## What next?

Have fun using pip to install lots of new packages! Why not try these resources, which require Python modules to be installed:

- [Getting started with GUIs](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-guis)
- [Getting started with the Twitter API](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api)
- [Shakespearean insult generator](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/shakespearean-insult-generator/)
